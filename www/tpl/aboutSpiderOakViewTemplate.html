    <p>The SpiderOak <%= platform %> application provides an easy way to access your data on the move, open ShareRooms, view historical versions, and quickly email files to friends, colleagues, and/or clients.</p>
    <p>However - you don’t have to be a SpiderOak user to enjoy the benefits of our <%= platform %> application. You can open the ShareRoom of a friend or colleague by entering their ShareID and a valid RoomKey. You can also email files through a secure link.</p>
